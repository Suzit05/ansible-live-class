create Limit in Ansible Playbook

Step-1 Create two Ubuntu instance
usig given inventory file

Step-2 use any of the host to limit the initialization
> sudo ansible-playbook -i inventory_jenkins.yml jenkins.yml --limit "aws1"


What does --limit do?
- By Default Anisble Runs the Playbook on all hosts in the hosts: group you specify.
- --limit restrict execution to only the hosts(s) you mentioned

- Example: if your inventory_jenkins file has aws1 and aws2 , and you run with --lkimit "aws1", then only aws1 get the jenkins installtion

Why It is Useful?
1. Testing changes safely.
    - suppose you are deploying new versionb of jenkins or a configuration change. you can try it first on aws1 (test server ) using --limit "aws1" instead of all servers.

2. Selective Execution:
    - May be only one server (aws2) needs the update /fix not all servers
    - instead of edidting playbooks or inventories you just run:

    ansible-playbook -i inventory_jenkins.yml jenkins.yml --limit "aws2"

3. Rolling Update:
    - in profuction you rerly update all serverat once
    - you might update one server at a time with --limit , check stabilty, then proceed.

4. Debugging:
    - if a task is failing you can target just one host for troubleshooting without affecting others

You can also use without --limit Vs With Limit
